## Infrastructure

<img src="images/infrastructure_image.png">

When a user first visit  Author's Haven Url, it hits the frontend of the application, the frontend then makes an api call to the backend which in turns makes request to the database server to get the data back to the user . 

As shown in the diagram, There is a VPC with two subnets (One is private subnet and the other is a public subnet)
Access to the private subnet is only through the private IP of the **nat-instance**
